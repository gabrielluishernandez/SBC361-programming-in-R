#  Programming in R

This is part of QMUL's year 3 BIO309 (previously SBC361) Research Methods and Communication II.

Lectures are in: Geography 1.26 from 11am to 1pm on September 27th and on October 11th.  If you're not 100% familiar with the things we're doing, or are curious about a different viewpoint, I recommend you join. 



## Practicals:

* [Practical 0](/2017/practical0.md): introduction to R
* [Practical 1](/2017/practical1.md): regular expressions
* [Practical 2](/2017/practical2.md): functions and for loops
* [Practical 3](/2017/practical3.md): practice exercises
* [Practical 4 - no specific plan]: First hour revision. Then they have an exam.


## Logistics for practicals

We will have a meeting at 11am on the Tuesday preceding each practical in the Bioinformatics room 5.08. Everyone TA-ing on that practical should already have worked through the practical & highlighted difficulties and potential questions. The meeting is the place to discuss how to best answer questions that the students may have.

## Notes to demonstrators

Our role here is to empower the students so they:
   * feel confident messing around in the commandline
   * can be confident that what they did is correct.

So we do not just want to give them answers. When you're talking to a student, *force* them to think. For example, if they ask a question, answer with a simpler question that helps to decompose the problem. Iterate as necessary. And/or check their skills - have they completely understood how to do the simple stuff? Encourage them to try things that will fail. Encourage them to decipher R's cryptic error messages - there is actually real information in them. Have *them* type; not you (and have them figure out *what* to type - avoid dictating).

When we are in the room we should be constantly talking to students. Don't wait for questions - many students are too shy/embarrassed to ask them and will be grateful if you come up to them.

If you see a student doing things badly (e.g. copying R-code from Word; not using the built-in R text editor; not indenting things; not using human-friendly variable names), make it clear that there are better ways that will make it easier for you & them to write/read/understand/learn/be productive.

Work through the relevant material in preparation for a team meeting 1 week before the practical. Please edit the document to improve it! If you'd like to discuss a point or give a suggestion, you can email the group. The meeting will be an additional opportunity to clarify if/what needs to be revised/improved, or what the different possible approaches are for a given exercise (and their advantages/disadvantages).

### Additionally:
* ensure that you know how to do this stuff.
* undergraduates should have done http://tryr.codeschool.com/ and the introductory practical0 before the first practical - you should be on top of all basic R handling too. If you have any doubts, ask questions BEFORE you are with students.
* The practicals are not necessarily easy/intuitive.
  * you should have worked through your practical at least 1 week beforehand. Where you struggled is likely where students will also struggle.
  * you guys can help each other out
* We are using the [Hadley Wickham style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* For many exercises there are multiple possible solutions. That's cool. Some may be easier, some may suck. 
* You are welcome (but not obliged!) to attend the lectures where we'll be going over the basics.
* The practicals as we have them are imperfect. Don't hesitate to suggest changes (as github issues or pull requests or in person).
